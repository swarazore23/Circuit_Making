So we decided to make a camera using the knowledge of circuits
We have used LED's and buzzer in parallel combination for it to work
The circuit gets complete on pressing the button of the camera, thus, works as an interactive circuit
On pressing the button of the camera, there is a flash of red light and the sound of the buzzer
Internally both these are connected to a battery
This was our output for an interactive circuit
